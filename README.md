# Module_1_Challenge (Kickstarting with Excel)

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis
There is an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She's estimating a budget of over $10,000 and is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. So, she's asking an Excel expert for some help. 

The purpose of this project is to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a projects campaign successful. The analysis of the data will give us insights to help Louise plan her own and set it up for success. Using Excel to analyze current site data, we'll help her gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we'll be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful Kicstarter campaigns for theater was May. On the other hand, May was also the month that had the most failed cases as well although June, July, August, and October all had virtually the same number of failed campaigns launched.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
