# Module_1_Challenge (Kickstarting with Excel)

## Overview of Project
Here we have Louise and she is a promising playwright. She recently wrote a play called Fever and she can't wait to put it on the stage. As of now, her budget is about $10,000 but she has no money to fund it. So she has come to me to ask for help so she can figure out how to proceed with her very first fundraising campaign.  

As an Excel expert with crowdfunding data in hand, I will be analyzing the data to see what makes a campaign successful one. And based on the analysis, I will be able to help Louis decide when she should start the campaign as well as how much she should set her budget to be.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![](Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
The month that launched the most amount of successful fundraising campaigns for theater was May. On the other hand, May was also the month that had the most amount of failed cases as well although June, July, August, and October all had virtually the same number of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The campaigns are more likely to succeed in reaching the goal when the goal for fundraising is less than $1,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
